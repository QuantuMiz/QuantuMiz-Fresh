### Issue reporting/feature requests

* Are able to post issue in English. We cannot help you if you post non-english issue tracker. Try to use translator if you can't speak English.

* Follow the templates when writing your issue.
* Keep the issue as one. If you have several issue to report, don't hesitate to make new one instead of having multiple issue on single issue.
